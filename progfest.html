    <h1> The Challenge</h1>
    <<p><<u>This year's Progfest will be different from prior years.</u>
      It consist of data structure and algorithm exercises within Android applications
    The first part of the day will be a hour hands-on workshop on crearing very basic
    Android applications. The rest of the day will involve creating Andriod games that
    require the use of relatively sophisticated algorithms and data structures.</p>
    <li>All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - a good grasp of Java is required.</li>
    <li>Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: HashMaps, ArrayLists, Sets, Trees, Tries.</li>
    <li>Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first
        search.</li>
    <li>Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.</li>
    <li>Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator will make doing the projects
        easier.</li>
